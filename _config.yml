            High-Fidelity Polarimetric Implicit 3D Reconstruction with View-Dependent Physical Representation
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
            In this paper, we propose a polarimetric implicit 3D reconstruction method that integrates geometric and polarization information, enabling the production of high-quality meshes in complex scenes. For high-fidelity surface reconstruction, we introduce a view-dependent physical representation that thoroughly analyzes the subtle physical properties of reflections. The reconstruction process is further enhanced by a simple yet effective view-dependent detection algorithm and optimized using the principles of ray tracing and polarization. <br>

            Polarization State Attention Dehazing Network with a Simulated Polar-Haze Dataset
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
            In this paper, we introduce polarization cues to propose a haze simulation strategy to synthesize hazy data, ensuring visually pleasing results that adhere to physical laws. Leveraging on the simulated Polar-Haze dataset, we present a polarization state attention dehazing network (PSADNet), which consists of a polarization extraction module and a polarization dehazing module. The proposed polarization extraction model incorporates an attention mechanism to capture high-level image features related to polarization and chromaticity. The polarization dehazing module utilizes these features derived from the polarization analysis to enhance image dehazing capabilities while preserving the accuracy of the polarization information. <br>

            A Cross-Consistency Strategy for Clearer Perception in Low-Light Haze
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
            In this paper, we introduce two key techniques: a cross-consistency dehazing-enhancement framework and a physically based simulation for generating a low-light hazy dataset. The framework is specically designed to improve the visibility of input images by leveraging information from various sub-tasks, while the simulation is developed to create datasets with ground truth using the proposed low-light hazy imaging model. <br>

            3D Photography with One-shot Portrait Relighting
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
            In this paper, we present a physical-based framework that explicitly models 3D photography with relighting from a one-shot portrait. By extracting facial albedo and rendering realistic reflected light, our method is capable of generating novel views with different lighting conditions, which can faithfully deliver realistic rendered results. <br>

            Polarization Guided Specular Reflection Separation
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
            In this paper, we derive a polarization guided model to incorporate the polarization information into a designed iteration optimization separation strategy to separate the specular reflection. The proposed polarization guided model can generate a polarization chromaticity image, which is able to reveal the intrinsic geometrical profile of the input image. <br>

            A Sparse Representation Based Joint Demosaicing Method for Single-Chip Polarized Color Sensor
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
            For newly released single-chip polarized color sensor, we present a sparse representation-based optimization strategy that utilizes chromatic information and polarimetric information to jointly reconstruct the information. In addition, we build an optical data acquisition system to collect a dataset, which contains various sources of polarization. <br>

          Convolutional Demosaicing Network for Joint Chromatic and Polarimetric Imagery
        description: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs
          In this letter, we collect the first chromatic-polarization dataset and propose a Chromatic-Polarization Demosaicing Network (CPDNet) to address this joint chromatic and polarimetric image demosaicing issue. The proposed CPDNet is composed of the residual block and the multi-task structure with the costumed loss function. <br>
